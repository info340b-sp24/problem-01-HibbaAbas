    <p>Hari Seldon is from Issac Asimov's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series">Foundation series</a>. 
        He was the creater of psychohistory; a new scientific field that combines history, sociology, and math to make 
        predictions about
        the future of large inertias. He predicted the fall of the Galactic empire and set a complex 
        plan in motion to reduce the following dark ages significantly.
